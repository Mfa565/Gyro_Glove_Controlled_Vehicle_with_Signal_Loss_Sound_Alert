About this project
This repository houses the code and documentation for a gyro glove controlled vehicle that detects signal loss and emits an audible alert. The work was completed as part of the Control Systems Technology course of my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. The project blends elements of robotics, control systems, embedded programming, and data structures to deliver a compact, demonstrable system that responds to user input via a glove-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) and provides a clear alert when control signals are lost.

Why this project exists
- Demonstrate closed-loop control ideas on a small scale vehicle.
- Explore sensor fusion concepts using a wearable IMU as the input device.
- Provide a robust signal-loss alert that helps ensure safety in semi-autonomous operations.
- Exercise software engineering practices in embedded environments, including debugging and test strategies.

What you get
- A working firmware framework for a glove-based control interface.
- A vehicle control loop that translates glove motion into vehicle commands.
- A signal loss detector that triggers a sound alert when control input is interrupted.
- A modular codebase designed for extensions, tests, and improvements.
- Documentation that covers hardware, software, and usage.

How it works
- The glove carries an IMU that streams orientation and motion data to a microcontroller.
- The vehicle runs a simple motor-driving loop that interprets control signals as speed and steering commands.
- A watchdog mechanism monitors the integrity of the control link. If the signal fails or becomes unstable, the system switches to a safe mode and sounds an alert.
- The alert is produced by a buzzer or speaker connected to the microcontroller, providing an immediate audible cue.

Design goals
- Clarity: straightforward code paths and readable comments.
- Portability: components chosen to fit common Arduino-compatible hardware.
- Robustness: simple fail-safes for signal loss and sensor glitches.
- Extensibility: clean separation between glove-side input handling and vehicle-side actuation.

Hardware components (typical)
Note: The exact parts can vary. This list reflects common choices for a glove-to-vehicle control setup.

- Arduino-compatible microcontroller (Uno, Mega, or compatible)
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor (e.g., MPU-6050, ICM-20689)
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N or A4988/DRV8825 for stepper systems)
- DC motors or a small rover chassis
- Buzzer or small speaker for the signal loss alert
- Bluetooth, RF, or other short-range wireless module for the control link (optional, depending on your glove-to-vehicle interface)
- Power supply for the vehicle (battery pack appropriate for the motor driver and motors)
- Miscellaneous: wires, breadboard or PCB, voltage regulators, resistors, capacitors

Software architecture
- Firmware layer (Arduino/C++): Reads IMU data, processes motion, maps to vehicle commands, and drives motors. It also monitors the control link for integrity and triggers the alert on signal loss.
- Input handling module: Interfaces with the glove IMU, performs calibration, filters noise, and converts motion into a control signal.
- Control loop: A simple proportional-like controller that translates orientation and motion into motor commands. It includes a safety check for signal loss.
- Sound alert module: Produces the audible alert when signal loss is detected.
- Logging and debugging: Lightweight logging with timestamps or event markers to help trace behavior during testing.
- Data structures: State enums for vehicle mode, signal status, and calibration state; lightweight buffers for IMU data.

Data structures and algorithms
- State management
  - VehicleState: {IDLE, ACTIVE, SAFETY}
  - SignalStatus: {OK, WARNING, LOST}
  - CalibrationPhase: {NOT_CALIBRATED, CALIBRATING, CALIBRATED}
- Control signal processing
  - Input normalization: Raw IMU data to a normalized command range
  - Dead zones: Small motions do not produce vehicle commands
  - Smoothing: Simple moving average to reduce jitter
- Signal loss detection
  - Watchdog timer: Detects if IMU data or control link fails to update within a threshold
  - Threshold checks: If data rate or message integrity falls below threshold, switch to LOST
  - Fail-safe: Bring vehicle to a safe stop or slow descent into a controlled idle
- Sound alert design
  - Audible cue pattern to denote signal loss state
  - Repeat until signal is restored or reset
